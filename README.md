# A New Spoon
Redesign of Spoon University (Step one of ???)

So for new people and people that know of the old repo. Here's the spiel this project is one of four. Its goal is to breakdown what makes SpoonUniversity awesome and break down into teeny tiny byte size pieces. Thinking about it now it might require megabyte pieces, but that'll be later. So in this I hope to recreate the experience of enjoying articles about food. If you don't like food well maybe the code will be decent to look at. Also if you do notice anything that your like 'OMG your a god howd you do this' or 'Hey idiot the sites broken', feel free to use the issues (located to the right of <> Code). As for the tasklist and what is being developed hit me up in issues and I can add you.
  
  Till Next Time
