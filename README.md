# A New Spoon
Redesign of Spoon University (Step one of ???)

So for new people and people that know of the old repo. Here's the spiel this project is one of four. Its goal is to breakdown what makes SpoonUniversity awesome and break down into teeny tiny byte size pieces. Thinking about it now it might require megabyte pieces, but that'll be later. So in this I hope to recreate the experience of enjoying articles about food. If you don't like food well maybe the code will be decent to look at. Also if you do notice anything that your like 'OMG your a god howd you do this' or 'Hey idiot the sites broken', feel free to use the issues (located to the right of <> Code). As for the tasklist and what is being developed hit me up in issues and I can add you.
  
  Till Next Time  
  Your Favorite GalacticNinja :D
  
  UPDATE :D - There is is a working site. That is meant to display what is working at the moment feel free to use that as a progress tracker or whatever you like. But do visit and tell me what is wrong. It is responsive so do use a variety of devices when testing this. https://thegalacticninja.github.io/A_New_Spoon/
  
  UPDATE :D - So with the working site up and possible work to be done on the site I feel this project is going pretty well. Not the greatest but not the worst. Unfortunately I have to put this project on the down low for now. I know its unfortunate not a lot of updates will be happening here. I will keep this up and try to comeback to this project in the future. I need to get things on track for life and also I have taken several smaller projects that focus on design and client work. So till next time, see ya later!
